QUESTION:

Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. 

Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.

Input format:
First input: a side of a square in integer

Second input: length of a rectangle in integer

Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer

Fourth input: radius of a circle in float

Output format:

The first output should be the area of a square in integer

The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer

The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places

Sample Input:

5
